Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) for global health status, physical functioning, dyspnea, and cough favored sotorasib over docetaxel. Here, we report sotorasib's additional impact on quality of life (QOL). METHODS: In CodeBreaK 200, 345 patients who had progressed after prior therapy received sotorasib (960\u202fmg orally daily) or docetaxel (75\u202fmg/m(2) intravenously every 3\u202fweeks). Validated questionnaires captured patients' perception of their QOL and symptom burden for key secondary and exploratory PRO endpoints, including the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) and Quality-of-life Questionnaire Lung Cancer 13 (EORTC QLQ-LC13), question GP5 from the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Tool General Form (FACT-G GP5), PRO-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE), and 5-level EuroQOL-5 dimensions (EQ-5D-5L) including visual analog scale (EQ-5D VAS). Change from baseline to week 12 was assessed with generalized estimating equations for ordinal outcomes. RESULTS: Patients receiving sotorasib were less bothered by treatment side effects than those receiving docetaxel (odds ratio [OR] 5.7) and experienced symptoms at lower severity (pain: OR 2.9; aching muscles: OR 4.4; aching joints: OR 4.2; mouth or throat sores: OR 4.3). Further, patients' symptoms interfered less with usual/daily activities (pain: OR 3.2; aching muscles: OR 3.9; aching joints: OR 10.7). QOL remained stable with sotorasib but worsened with docetaxel (change from baseline in EQ-5D VAS score: 1.5 vs -8.4 at cycle 1\u202fday 5 and 2.2 vs -5.8 at week 12). CONCLUSIONS: Patients receiving sotorasib reported less severe symptoms than those receiving docetaxel. In addition to improving clinical efficacy outcomes, sotorasib maintained QOL versus docetaxel, suggesting sotorasib may be a more tolerable treatment option for patients with pretreated, KRAS G12C-mutated advanced NSCLC.","acronym":"","author1":"Waterhouse DM","database":0,"exclusion_reason":0,"id":2,"pmid":39303400,"project":1,"record":2,"registration_number":"","search":null,"selection":0,"source":"Lung Cancer. 2024 Oct;196:107921. doi: 10.1016/j.lungcan.2024.107921.

We compared the efficacy and safety of sotorasib with a standard-of-care treatment in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with the KRAS(G12C) mutation who had been previously treated with other anticancer drugs. METHODS: We conducted a randomised, open-label phase 3 trial at 148 centres in 22 countries. We recruited patients aged at least 18 years with KRAS(G12C)-mutated advanced NSCLC, who progressed after previous platinum-based chemotherapy and a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor. Key exclusion criteria included new or progressing untreated brain lesions or symptomatic brain lesions, previously identified oncogenic driver mutation other than KRAS(G12C) for which an approved therapy is available (eg EGFR or ALK), previous treatment with docetaxel (neoadjuvant or adjuvant docetaxel was allowed if the tumour did not progress within 6 months after the therapy was terminated), previous treatment with a direct KRAS(G12C) inhibitor, systemic anticancer therapy within 28 days of study day 1, and therapeutic or palliative radiation therapy within 2 weeks of treatment initiation. We randomly assigned (1:1) patients to oral sotorasib (960 mg once daily) or intravenous docetaxel (75 mg/m(2) once every 3 weeks) in an open-label manner using interactive response technology. Randomisation was stratified by number of previous lines of therapy in advanced disease (1 vs 2 vs >2), ethnicity (Asian vs non-Asian), and history of CNS metastases (present or absent). Treatment continued until an independent central confirmation of disease progression, intolerance, initiation of another anticancer therapy, withdrawal of consent, or death, whichever occurred first. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival, which was assessed by a blinded, independent central review in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was assessed in all treated patients. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04303780, and is active but no longer recruiting. FINDINGS: Between June 4, 2020, and April 26, 2021, 345 patients were randomly assigned to receive sotorasib (n=171 [50%]) or docetaxel (n=174 [50%]). 169 (99%) patients in the sotorasib group and 151 (87%) in the docetaxel group received at least one dose. After a median follow-up of 17\u00b77 months (IQR 16\u00b74-20\u00b71), the study met its primary endpoint of a statistically significant increase in the progression-free survival for sotorasib, compared with docetaxel (median progression-free survival 5\u00b76 months [95% CI 4\u00b73-7\u00b78] vs 4\u00b75 months [3\u00b70-5\u00b77]; hazard ratio 0\u00b766 [0\u00b751-0\u00b786]; p=0\u00b70017). Sotorasib was well tolerated, with fewer grade 3 or worse (n=56 [33%] vs n=61 [40%]) and serious treatment-related adverse events compared with docetaxel (n=18 [11%] vs n=34 [23%]). For sotorasib, the most common treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or worse were diarrhoea (n= 20 [12%]), alanine aminotransferase increase (n=13 [8%]), and aspartate aminotransferase increase (n=9 [5%]). For docetaxel, the most common treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or worse were neutropenia (n=13 [9%]), fatigue (n=9 [6%]), and febrile neutropenia (n=8 [5%]). INTERPRETATION: Sotorasib significantly increased progression-free survival and had a more favourable safety profile, compared with docetaxel, in patients with advanced NSCLC with the KRAS(G12C) mutation and who had been previously treated with other anticancer drugs.

Monotherapy with KRAS G12C inhibitors has yielded only modest efficacy. Combining the KRAS G12C inhibitor sotorasib with panitumumab, an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor, may be an effective strategy. METHODS: In this phase 3, multicenter, open-label, randomized trial, we assigned patients with chemorefractory metastatic colorectal cancer with mutated KRAS G12C who had not received previous treatment with a KRAS G12C inhibitor to receive sotorasib at a dose of 960 mg once daily plus panitumumab (53 patients), sotorasib at a dose of 240 mg once daily plus panitumumab (53 patients), or the investigator's choice of trifluridine-tipiracil or regorafenib (standard care; 54 patients). The primary end point was progression-free survival as assessed by blinded independent central review according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1. Key secondary end points were overall survival and objective response. RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 7.8 months (range, 0.1 to 13.9), the median progression-free survival was 5.6 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.2 to 6.3) and 3.9 months (95% CI, 3.7 to 5.8) in the 960-mg sotorasib-panitumumab and 240-mg sotorasib-panitumumab groups, respectively, as compared with 2.2 months (95% CI, 1.9 to 3.9) in the standard-care group. The hazard ratio for disease progression or death in the 960-mg sotorasib-panitumumab group as compared with the standard-care group was 0.49 (95% CI, 0.30 to 0.80; P\u2009=\u20090.006), and the hazard ratio in the 240-mg sotorasib-panitumumab group was 0.58 (95% CI, 0.36 to 0.93; P\u2009=\u20090.03). Overall survival data are maturing. The objective response was 26.4% (95% CI, 15.3 to 40.3), 5.7% (95% CI, 1.2 to 15.7), and 0% (95% CI, 0.0 to 6.6) in the 960-mg sotorasib-panitumumab, 240-mg sotorasib-panitumumab, and standard-care groups, respectively. Treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or higher occurred in 35.8%, 30.2%, and 43.1% of patients, respectively. Skin-related toxic effects and hypomagnesemia were the most common adverse events observed with sotorasib-panitumumab. CONCLUSIONS: In this phase 3 trial of a KRAS G12C inhibitor plus an EGFR inhibitor in patients with chemorefractory metastatic colorectal cancer, both doses of sotorasib in combination with panitumumab resulted in longer progression-free survival than standard treatment.

This analysis investigated the impact of a high-calorie high-fat meal on the pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of sotorasib in both healthy volunteers and patients with KRAS G12C advanced solid tumors. Each subject received a single oral dose of 360 or 960\u00a0mg of sotorasib under fasted conditions or with a high-fat meal (fed conditions). The geometric least squares means (GLSM) ratios (fed/fasted) for 360\u00a0mg of sotorasib C(max) and AUC(inf) were 1.03 and 1.38, respectively, in healthy volunteers (N\u00a0=\u00a014). The GLSM ratios (fed/fasted) for C(max) and AUC(0-24h) were 1.38 and 1.75, respectively, with 360\u00a0mg of sotorasib in cancer patients (N\u00a0=\u00a02). The GLSM ratios (fed/fasted) for C(max) and AUC(0-24h) were 0.660 and 1.25, respectively, with 960\u00a0mg of sotorasib in cancer patients (N\u00a0=\u00a08). Sotorasib was well tolerated in fast and fed conditions. The impact of a high-fat meal on sotorasib exposure is less than a 2-fold increase or decrease in C(max) and AUCs.","acronym":"","author1":"Cardona P","database":0,"exclusion_reason":0,"id":5,"pmid":39016337,"project":1,"registration_number":"","search":null,"selection":0,"source":"Clin Pharmacol Drug Dev. 2024 Nov;13(11):1219-1226. doi: 10.1002/cpdd.1452.

The impact of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 inhibition and induction on sotorasib pharmacokinetics (PKs) was evaluated in 2 separate studies in healthy volunteers (N = 14/study). The impact of CYP3A4 inhibition was interrogated utilizing repeat doses of 200\u00a0mg of itraconazole, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, on 360\u00a0mg of sotorasib PKs. The impact of CYP3A4 induction was interrogated utilizing multiple doses of 600\u00a0mg of rifampin, a strong CYP3A4 inducer. Additionally, the impact of organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1/3 inhibition on 960\u00a0mg of sotorasib PKs was interrogated after a single dose of 600\u00a0mg of rifampin. CYP3A4 inhibition did not significantly impact sotorasib C(max) but did lead to a 26% increase in sotorasib AUC(inf). CYP3A4 induction decreased sotorasib C(max) by 35% and AUC(inf) by 51%. OATP1B1/3 inhibition decreased sotorasib C(max) and AUC(inf) by 16% and 23%, respectively. These results support that sotorasib can be given together with strong CYP3A4 and OATP1B1/3 inhibitors but the co-administration of sotorasib and strong CYP3A4 inducers should be avoided.","acronym":"","author1":"Cardona P","database":0,"exclusion_reason":0,"id":6,"pmid":38421129,"project":1,"registration_number":"","search":null,"selection":1,"source":"Clin Pharmacol Drug Dev. 2024 Jul;13(7):810-818. doi: 10.1002/cpdd.1392.
