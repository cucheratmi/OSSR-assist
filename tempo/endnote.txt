%X Transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR amyloidosis) is a rare disease that results from the deposition of misfolded transthyretin (TTR) protein from the plasma into tissues as amyloid fibrils, leading to polyneuropathy and cardiomyopathy. IONIS-TTR(Rx) (ISIS 420915) is a 2nd-Generation 2'-O-(2-methoxyethyl) modified "2'-MOE" antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) that targets the TTR RNA transcript and reduces the levels of the TTR transcript through an RNaseH1 mechanism of action, leading to reductions in both mutant and wild-type TTR protein. The activity of IONIS-TTR(Rx) to decrease TTR protein levels was studied in transgenic mice bearing the Ile84Ser human TTR mutant, in cynomolgus monkeys and in healthy human volunteers. Robust (>80%) reductions of plasma TTR protein were obtained in all three species treated with IONIS-TTR(Rx), which in mice and monkeys was associated with substantial reductions in hepatic TTR RNA levels. These effects were dose-dependent and lasted for weeks post-dosing. In a Phase 1 healthy volunteer study, treatment with IONIS-TTR(Rx) for four weeks was well tolerated without any remarkable safety issues. TTR protein reductions up to 96% in plasma were observed. These nonclinical and clinical results support the ongoing Phase 3 development of IONIS-TTR(Rx) in patients with ATTR amyloidosis.

%X BACKGROUND: Hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis is caused by pathogenic single-nucleotide variants in the gene encoding transthyretin ( TTR) that induce transthyretin misfolding and systemic deposition of amyloid. Progressive amyloid accumulation leads to multiorgan dysfunction and death. Inotersen, a 2'- O-methoxyethyl-modified antisense oligonucleotide, inhibits hepatic production of transthyretin. METHODS: We conducted an international, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 15-month, phase 3 trial of inotersen in adults with stage 1 (patient is ambulatory) or stage 2 (patient is ambulatory with assistance) hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis with polyneuropathy. Patients were randomly assigned, in a 2:1 ratio, to receive weekly subcutaneous injections of inotersen (300 mg) or placebo. The primary end points were the change in the modified Neuropathy Impairment Score+7 (mNIS+7; range, -22.3 to 346.3, with higher scores indicating poorer function; minimal clinically meaningful change, 2 points) and the change in the score on the patient-reported Norfolk Quality of Life-Diabetic Neuropathy (QOL-DN) questionnaire (range, -4 to 136, with higher scores indicating poorer quality of life). A decrease in scores indicated improvement. RESULTS: A total of 172 patients (112 in the inotersen group and 60 in the placebo group) received at least one dose of a trial regimen, and 139 (81%) completed the intervention period. Both primary efficacy assessments favored inotersen: the difference in the least-squares mean change from baseline to week 66 between the two groups (inotersen minus placebo) was -19.7 points (95% confidence interval [CI], -26.4 to -13.0; P<0.001) for the mNIS+7 and -11.7 points (95% CI, -18.3 to -5.1; P<0.001) for the Norfolk QOL-DN score. These improvements were independent of disease stage, mutation type, or the presence of cardiomyopathy. There were five deaths in the inotersen group and none in the placebo group. The most frequent serious adverse events in the inotersen group were glomerulonephritis (in 3 patients [3%]) and thrombocytopenia (in 3 patients [3%]), with one death associated with one of the cases of grade 4 thrombocytopenia. Thereafter, all patients received enhanced monitoring. CONCLUSIONS: Inotersen improved the course of neurologic disease and quality of life in patients with hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis. Thrombocytopenia and glomerulonephritis were managed with enhanced monitoring. (Funded by Ionis Pharmaceuticals; NEURO-TTR ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01737398 .).

%X BACKGROUND: The phase 3 NEURO-TTRansform trial showed eplontersen treatment for 65 weeks reduced transthyretin (TTR), halted progression of neuropathy impairment, and improved quality of life (QoL) in adult patients with hereditary TTR-mediated amyloidosis with polyneuropathy (ATTRv-PN), vs. historical placebo. METHODS: NEURO-TTRansform enrolled patients with ATTRv-PN. A subset of patients were randomized to receive subcutaneous inotersen 300 mg weekly (Weeks 1-34) and subsequently switched to subcutaneous eplontersen 45 mg every 4 weeks (Weeks 37-81). Change in serum TTR and treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were evaluated through Week 85. Effects on neuropathy impairment, QoL, and nutritional status were also evaluated. RESULTS: Of 24 patients randomized to inotersen, 20 (83%) switched to eplontersen at Week 37 and four discontinued due to AEs/investigator decision. Absolute change in serum TTR was greater after switching from inotersen (-74.3%; Week 35) to eplontersen (-80.6%; Week 85). From the end of inotersen treatment, neuropathy impairment and QoL were stable (i.e., did not progress) while on eplontersen, and there was no deterioration in nutritional status. TEAEs were fewer with eplontersen (Weeks 37-85; 19/20 [95%] patients) compared with inotersen (up to Week 35; 24/24 [100%] patients). Mean platelet counts decreased during inotersen treatment (mean nadir reduction ‒40.7%) and returned to baseline during eplontersen treatment (mean nadir reduction, ‒3.2%). CONCLUSIONS: Switching from inotersen to eplontersen further reduced serum TTR, halted disease progression, stabilized QoL, restored platelet count, and improved tolerability, without deterioration in nutritional status. This supports a positive benefit-risk profile for patients with ATTRv-PN who switch from inotersen to eplontersen.

%X AIMS: Patients with transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM) present with diverse left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). This study assessed tafamidis efficacy by baseline LVEF in the phase 3 Tafamidis in Transthyretin Cardiomyopathy Clinical Trial (ATTR-ACT) and its long-term extension (LTE) study. METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients were randomized to 30 months of tafamidis or placebo treatment in ATTR-ACT. On completion, patients could join an LTE study to receive tafamidis. All-cause mortality (death, heart transplant, or cardiac mechanical assist device implantation) from baseline to the end of follow-up was assessed in patients continuously treated with tafamidis (80 mg meglumine or 61 mg free acid) or delayed tafamidis treatment (placebo in ATTR-ACT; tafamidis in the LTE study) according to baseline LVEF (<50% or ≥50%). Supportive outcomes were evaluated over a shorter follow-up. Patients with baseline LVEF <50% (n = 177: 88 tafamidis- and 89 placebo-treated) had signs of more severe heart failure, a higher proportion were Black, and had variant ATTR-CM than those with LVEF ≥50% (n = 171: 85 tafamidis- and 86 placebo-treated). At the end of follow-up (median 60-64 months), all-cause mortality was numerically higher in patients with baseline LVEF <50%; however, consistent with supportive findings, continuous tafamidis treatment was associated with a 47% reduction in mortality risk compared with delayed tafamidis treatment in patients with LVEF <50% and ≥50% (hazard ratio 0.53 [95% confidence interval 0.367-0.758]; p < 0.001, and 0.53 [0.344-0.818]; p < 0.01, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Early initiation of tafamidis is associated with reduced mortality in patients with ATTR-CM, irrespective of initial LVEF value.

%X INTRODUCTION/AIMS: The degree of change in neuropathic impairment and quality of life (QoL) that is clinically meaningful to patients with hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis with polyneuropathy (ATTRv-PN) is not established. This study aimed to estimate the magnitude of treatment differences that are meaningful to patients in measures of neuropathy and QoL and to determine whether eplontersen achieved a meaningful improvement versus placebo. METHODS: Data from the NEURO-TTRansform trial on patients with ATTRv-PN treated with eplontersen (n = 141) or historical placebo (n = 59) were used. Anchor-based approaches were used to estimate thresholds for meaningful differences in the modified Neuropathy Impairment Score +7 (mNIS+7) composite score, Norfolk QoL-Diabetic Neuropathy (Norfolk QoL-DN) total score, Neuropathy Symptoms and Change (NSC) total score, and modified body mass index (mBMI). Differences between the least squares means of the treatment groups were analyzed. RESULTS: Meaningful improvement in mNIS+7 was estimated as -4.0 points and deterioration as 1.8 points. The estimated ranges of meaningful improvement and deterioration in Norfolk QoL-DN were -12.8 to -4.0 points, and 5.9 to 14.7 points, respectively. For NSC, ranges were -2.4 to -1.3 points for meaningful improvement, and 0.6 to 5.8 points for deterioration. The estimated meaningful improvement in mBMI was 9.8 kg/m(2) × g/L and deterioration was -40.9 kg/m(2) × g/L. Improvements in each measure with eplontersen versus placebo were greater than the estimates of meaningful differences. DISCUSSION: Eplontersen demonstrated a clinically meaningful effect on neuropathic impairment, QoL, and nutritional status. Such estimates have implications for clinical practice and trials.

Treatment Outcome
%X BACKGROUND: Transthyretin amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM) is a progressive, fatal disease. Vutrisiran, a subcutaneously administered RNA interference therapeutic agent, inhibits the production of hepatic transthyretin. METHODS: In this double-blind, randomized trial, we assigned patients with ATTR-CM in a 1:1 ratio to receive vutrisiran (25 mg) or placebo every 12 weeks for up to 36 months. The primary end point was a composite of death from any cause and recurrent cardiovascular events. Secondary end points included death from any cause, the change from baseline in the distance covered on the 6-minute walk test, and the change from baseline in the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire-Overall Summary (KCCQ-OS) score. The efficacy end points were assessed in the overall population and in the monotherapy population (the patients who were not receiving tafamidis at baseline) and were tested hierarchically. RESULTS: A total of 655 patients underwent randomization; 326 were assigned to receive vutrisiran and 329 to receive placebo. Vutrisiran treatment led to a lower risk of death from any cause and recurrent cardiovascular events than placebo (hazard ratio in the overall population, 0.72; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.56 to 0.93; P = 0.01; hazard ratio in the monotherapy population, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.49 to 0.93; P = 0.02) and a lower risk of death from any cause through 42 months (hazard ratio in the overall population, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.46 to 0.90; P = 0.01). Among the patients in the overall population, 125 in the vutrisiran group and 159 in the placebo group had at least one primary end-point event. In the overall population, treatment with vutrisiran resulted in less of a decline in the distance covered on the 6-minute walk test than placebo (least-squares mean difference, 26.5 m; 95% CI, 13.4 to 39.6; P<0.001) and less of a decline in the KCCQ-OS score (least-squares mean difference, 5.8 points; 95% CI, 2.4 to 9.2; P<0.001). Similar benefits were observed in the monotherapy population. The incidence of adverse events was similar in the two groups (99% in the vutrisiran group and 98% in the placebo group); serious adverse events occurred in 62% of the patients in the vutrisiran group and in 67% of those in the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with ATTR-CM, treatment with vutrisiran led to a lower risk of death from any cause and cardiovascular events than placebo and preserved functional capacity and quality of life.

%X BACKGROUND: Transthyretin amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM) is a fatal disease, caused by misfolded transthyretin depositing as amyloid fibrils in the heart. Because disease progression is common, practical and sensitive methods are needed to monitor patients and optimize treatment decisions. Outpatient worsening heart failure (HF) (oral loop diuretic intensification or initiation) is simple to assess and has been shown to be prognostic of mortality in patients with ATTR-CM. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess the clinical and prognostic significance of and the effect of vutrisiran treatment on outpatient worsening HF in patients with ATTR-CM from HELIOS-B (A Study to Evaluate Vutrisiran in Patients With Transthyretin Amyloidosis With Cardiomyopathy). METHODS: Associations between outpatient worsening HF and a composite of all-cause mortality and recurrent cardiovascular (CV) events (CV hospitalizations and urgent HF visits), all-cause mortality, and other disease progression-related endpoints were evaluated. The impact of vutrisiran over 36 months on outpatient worsening HF and an expanded composite of all-cause mortality, recurrent CV events, and outpatient worsening HF was also assessed. RESULTS: Overall, 321 patients (49.1%) had ≥1 outpatient worsening HF, 245 (37.5%) had ≥1 CV event(s), and 120 (18.3%) died; 237 patients (36.2%) had no events. Patients with outpatient worsening HF had an increased risk of all-cause mortality and CV events (HR: 2.58; 95% CI: 2.04-3.27) and all-cause mortality (HR: 2.45; 95% CI: 1.70-3.52), as well as a greater deterioration in 6-minute walk test distance and Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire-Overall Summary score, and a greater increase in N-terminal prohormone of B-type natriuretic peptide. In recurrent event analyses over the double-blind period, vutrisiran vs placebo reduced the rate of outpatient worsening HF (relative rate ratio: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.56-0.78). Vutrisiran also reduced the risk of the composite of all-cause mortality, CV events, and outpatient worsening HF vs placebo (HR: 0.69; 95% CI: 0.57-0.83). CONCLUSIONS: Outpatient worsening HF was frequent in patients with ATTR-CM in HELIOS-B, was associated with increased mortality, and reduced by vutrisiran.

%X BACKGROUND: Outpatient worsening heart failure (HF), defined by initiation or intensification of diuretics, is adversely prognostic for patients with either reduced or preserved ejection fraction. OBJECTIVES: This study sought to investigate the prognostic value of outpatient worsening HF in transthyretin amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy and the effect of patisiran treatment. METHODS: Post hoc analyses of the APOLLO-B trial (NCT03997383) evaluated the associations between outpatient worsening HF (defined by oral diuretic initiation or intensification), measures of disease progression, and a composite endpoint of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular (CV) events. We further examined the effect of patisiran on outpatient worsening HF over 24 months (ie, during the double-blind and open-label extension periods). RESULTS: In APOLLO-B, 144 (40.1%) patients had no event, 157 (43.7%) had outpatient worsening HF, 13 (3.6%) required an urgent HF visit, 118 (32.9%) had a CV hospitalization, and 47 (13.1%) died. Outpatient worsening HF was associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality and CV events (HR: 2.21; 95% CI: 1.58-3.08), as well as a greater deterioration in 6-minute walk test distance, Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire-Overall Summary score, and NYHA functional class and a greater increase in N-terminal prohormone of B-type natriuretic peptide. Addition of outpatient diuretic initiation or intensification to the composite endpoint of all-cause mortality and CV events increased the overall number of patients having an event from 141 to 215 (a 52% increase). Patisiran reduced the risk of outpatient worsening HF (HR: 0.70; 95% CI: 0.51-0.96) over 24 months. CONCLUSIONS: During APOLLO-B, outpatient worsening HF in patients with transthyretin amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy was frequent, prognostic, and reduced by patisiran.

%X AG10 is a novel, potent, and selective oral transthyretin (TTR) stabilizer being developed to treat TTR amyloidosis (ATTR). This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluated safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics (ex vivo stabilization) of orally administered AG10 in healthy adult volunteers. Both mutant and wild-type ATTR are underdiagnosed diseases with limited therapeutic options. As TTR amyloidogenesis is initiated by dissociation of TTR tetramers destabilized due to inherited mutations or aging, AG10 is designed to treat the disease at its source. Four single and three multiple ascending dose levels of AG10 or matching placebo were orally administered. Safety and tolerability were assessed by vital signs, electrocardiogram, adverse events, and clinical laboratory tests. Pharmacokinetics were measured using a validated bioanalytical assay. Pharmacodynamics were assessed via three pharmacodynamic assays of TTR stabilization. AG10 was uniformly well tolerated, and no safety signals of clinical concern were observed. Pharmacokinetic observations included time to maximum concentration <1 hour, dose-dependent maximum concentration and area under the plasma concentration-time curve, low intersubject variability, and half-life ∼25 hr. Complete (>90%) stabilization of TTR was observed across the entire dosing interval at steady state on the highest dose tested. Serum TTR levels, an in vivo reflection of TTR stabilization by AG10, increased from baseline following 12 days of dosing. AG10 appears to be safe and well tolerated in healthy adult volunteers and can completely stabilize TTR across the dosing interval, establishing clinical proof of concept. Based on these data, AG10 has the potential to be a safe and effective treatment for patients with either mutant or wild-type ATTR.

Despite advances in slowing disease progression, there is no available treatment that depletes ATTR from the heart for the amelioration of cardiac dysfunction. NI006 is a recombinant human anti-ATTR antibody that was developed for the removal of ATTR by phagocytic immune cells. METHODS: In this phase 1, double-blind trial, we randomly assigned (in a 2:1 ratio) 40 patients with wild-type or variant ATTR cardiomyopathy and chronic heart failure to receive intravenous infusions of either NI006 or placebo every 4 weeks for 4 months. Patients were sequentially enrolled in six cohorts that received ascending doses (ranging from 0.3 to 60 mg per kilogram of body weight). After four infusions, patients were enrolled in an open-label extension phase in which they received eight infusions of NI006 with stepwise increases in the dose. The safety and pharmacokinetic profiles of NI006 were assessed, and cardiac imaging studies were performed. RESULTS: The use of NI006 was associated with no apparent drug-related serious adverse events. The pharmacokinetic profile of NI006 was consistent with that of an IgG antibody, and no antidrug antibodies were detected. At doses of at least 10 mg per kilogram, cardiac tracer uptake on scintigraphy and extracellular volume on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, both of which are imaging-based surrogate markers of cardiac amyloid load, appeared to be reduced over a period of 12 months. The median N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide and troponin T levels also seemed to be reduced. CONCLUSIONS: In this phase 1 trial of the recombinant human antibody NI006 for the treatment of patients with ATTR cardiomyopathy and heart failure, the use of NI006 was associated with no apparent drug-related serious adverse events.

%X AIMS: HELIOS-A was a Phase 3, open-label study of vutrisiran, an RNA interference therapeutic, in patients with hereditary transthyretin (ATTRv) amyloidosis with polyneuropathy. This analysis evaluated vutrisiran's impact on exploratory cardiac endpoints in HELIOS-A patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients were randomized 3:1 to subcutaneous vutrisiran 25 mg every 3 months or intravenous patisiran 0.3 mg/kg every 3 weeks (reference group) for 18 months. Exploratory cardiac endpoints included change from baseline in N-terminal prohormone of brain-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and echocardiographic parameters versus external placebo (APOLLO study). The modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population comprised randomized patients receiving any study drug (n = 122). A cardiac subpopulation with evidence of cardiac amyloid involvement (n = 40) was prespecified. (99m)Tc scintigraphy exploratory assessments in a planned vutrisiran-treated cohort at select sites were compared with baseline. At Month 18, vutrisiran demonstrated beneficial effects on NT-proBNP versus external placebo in the mITT and cardiac subpopulations (adjusted geometric mean fold change ratio [95% confidence interval] 0.480 [0.383-0.600], p = 9.606 × 10(-10) and 0.491 [0.337-0.716], p = 0.0004, respectively). Benefits or trends towards benefit in echocardiographic parameters versus external placebo were observed for both populations. In (99m)Tc scintigraphy assessments, 32/47 (68.1%) and 31/48 (64.6%) patients exhibited reduced normalized left ventricular total uptake and heart-to-contralateral lung ratio, respectively. Perugini grade was reduced or unchanged versus baseline in 55/57 (96.5%) evaluable patients. No increase in cardiac adverse events was observed with vutrisiran versus external placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Vutrisiran demonstrated evidence of potential benefit on cardiac manifestations in patients with ATTRv amyloidosis with polyneuropathy, with an acceptable safety profile.

Treatment Outcome
%X BACKGROUND: Transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy is characterized by the deposition of misfolded monomeric transthyretin (TTR) in the heart. Acoramidis is a high-affinity TTR stabilizer that acts to inhibit dissociation of tetrameric TTR and leads to more than 90% stabilization across the dosing interval as measured ex vivo. METHODS: In this phase 3, double-blind trial, we randomly assigned patients with transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy in a 2:1 ratio to receive acoramidis hydrochloride at a dose of 800 mg twice daily or matching placebo for 30 months. Efficacy was assessed in the patients who had an estimated glomerular filtration rate of at least 30 ml per minute per 1.73 m(2) of body-surface area. The four-step primary hierarchical analysis included death from any cause, cardiovascular-related hospitalization, the change from baseline in the N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) level, and the change from baseline in the 6-minute walk distance. We used the Finkelstein-Schoenfeld method to compare all potential pairs of patients within strata to generate a P value. Key secondary outcomes were death from any cause, the 6-minute walk distance, the score on the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire-Overall Summary, and the serum TTR level. RESULTS: A total of 632 patients underwent randomization. The primary analysis favored acoramidis over placebo (P<0.001); the corresponding win ratio was 1.8 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4 to 2.2), with 63.7% of pairwise comparisons favoring acoramidis and 35.9% favoring placebo. Together, death from any cause and cardiovascular-related hospitalization contributed more than half the wins and losses to the win ratio (58% of all pairwise comparisons); NT-proBNP pairwise comparisons yielded the highest ratio of wins to losses (23.3% vs. 7.0%). The overall incidence of adverse events was similar in the acoramidis group and the placebo group (98.1% and 97.6%, respectively); serious adverse events were reported in 54.6% and 64.9% of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy, the receipt of acoramidis resulted in a significantly better four-step primary hierarchical outcome containing components of mortality, morbidity, and function than placebo. Adverse events were similar in the two groups. (Funded by BridgeBio Pharma; ATTRibute-CM ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03860935.).

%X In the Tafamidis in Transthyretin Cardiomyopathy Clinical Trial, tafamidis significantly reduced all-cause mortality and cardiovascular-related hospitalizations in patients with transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM). ATTR-CM is associated with a significant burden of disease; further analysis of patient-reported quality of life will provide additional data on the efficacy of tafamidis. In the Tafamidis in Transthyretin Cardiomyopathy Clinical Trial, 441 adult patients with ATTR-CM were randomized (2:1:2) to tafamidis 80 mg, tafamidis 20 mg, or placebo for 30 months, with pooled tafamidis (80 mg and 20 mg) compared with placebo. Change in Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire Overall Summary (KCCQ-OS) domain scores, EQ-5D-3L scores, and patient global assessment, were prespecified exploratory end points. A greater proportion of patients improved KCCQ-OS score at month 30 with tafamidis (41.8%) versus placebo (21.4%). Tafamidis significantly reduced the decline in all 4 KCCQ-OS domains (p <0.0001 for all), and in EQ-5D-3L utility (0.09 [confidence interval 0.05 to 0.12]; p <0.0001) and EQ visual analog scale (9.11 [confidence interval 5.39 to 12.83]; p <0.0001) scores at month 30 versus placebo. A larger proportion of tafamidis-treated patients reported their patient global assessment improved at month 30 (42.3% vs 23.8% with placebo). In conclusion, tafamidis effectively reduced the decline in patient-reported outcomes, providing further insight into its efficacy in health-related quality of life in patients with ATTR-CM.

%X BACKGROUND: Transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM) is an underdiagnosed chronic disease associated with progressive heart failure that results in impaired quality of life, repeated hospitalizations, and premature death. Acoramidis is a selective, oral transthyretin stabilizer recently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of ATTR-CM. In a phase 3, randomized, double-blind study (ATTRibute-CM [Efficacy and Safety of AG10 in Subjects With Transthyretin Amyloid Cardiomyopathy]), acoramidis was well tolerated and showed clinical efficacy in improving the primary endpoint, a hierarchical combination of all-cause mortality (ACM), cardiovascular-related hospitalization (CVH), N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide level, and 6-minute walk distance. OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to characterize the efficacy of acoramidis on ACM and CVH. METHODS: In ATTRibute-CM, participants with ATTR-CM were randomized 2:1 to receive acoramidis hydrochloride (800 mg twice daily) or placebo for 30 months. Efficacy analyses were conducted in the modified intention-to-treat population (participants with a baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate ≥30 mL/min/1.73 m(2)). CVH and the composite of ACM or first CVH were plotted by using Kaplan-Meier curves and summarized with a stratified Cox proportional hazards model. The annualized frequency of CVH was analyzed by using a negative binomial regression model. Subgroup analyses were conducted for the composite of ACM or first CVH. RESULTS: Of the 632 participants randomized to treatment, 611 (97%) were included in efficacy analyses (acoramidis, n = 409; placebo, n = 202). Compared with placebo, acoramidis reduced the occurrence of the composite of ACM or first CVH (acoramidis, 35.9%; placebo, 50.5%; HR: 0.64; 95% CI: 0.50-0.83; P = 0.0008) and of first CVH (acoramidis, 26.7%; placebo, 42.6%; HR: 0.60; 95% CI: 0.45-0.80; P = 0.0005), with Kaplan-Meier curves separating at month 3 and continuing to diverge through month 30. Annualized frequency of CVH was reduced with acoramidis compared with placebo (acoramidis, 0.22; placebo, 0.45; relative risk ratio: 50%; 95% CI: 0.36-0.70; P < 0.0001). The efficacy of acoramidis on the composite of ACM or first CVH was consistent across subgroups. Acoramidis was well tolerated, with no safety signals of potential clinical concern identified. CONCLUSIONS: In participants with ATTR-CM, acoramidis reduced the composite of ACM or first CVH vs placebo, with an early effect driven by a reduction in CVH.

%X BACKGROUND: In the phase 3 randomized controlled study ATTRibute-CM (Efficacy and Safety of AG10 in Subjects With Transthyretin Amyloid Cardiomyopathy), acoramidis, a transthyretin stabilizer, demonstrated significant efficacy on the primary end point. Participants with transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy who completed ATTRibute-CM were invited to enroll in an open-label extension study (OLE). We report the efficacy and safety data of acoramidis in participants who completed ATTRibute-CM and enrolled in the ongoing OLE. METHODS: Participants who previously received acoramidis through month 30 in ATTRibute-CM continued to receive it (continuous acoramidis), and those who received placebo through month 30 were switched to acoramidis (placebo to acoramidis). Participants who received concomitant tafamidis in ATTRibute-CM were required to discontinue it to be eligible to enroll in the OLE. Clinical efficacy outcomes analyzed through month 42 included time to event for all-cause mortality (ACM) or first cardiovascular-related hospitalization (CVH), ACM alone, first CVH alone, ACM or recurrent CVH, change from baseline in NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide), 6-minute walk distance, serum transthyretin, and Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire Overall Summary score. Safety outcomes were analyzed through month 42. RESULTS: Overall, 438 of 632 participants in ATTRibute-CM completed treatment, and 389 enrolled in the ongoing OLE (263 continuous acoramidis and 126 placebo to acoramidis). The hazard ratio for ACM or first CVH was 0.57 (95% CI, 0.46-0.72) at month 42 based on a stratified Cox proportional hazards model (P<0.0001) favoring continuous acoramidis. Similar analyses were performed on ACM alone and first CVH alone, with hazard ratios of 0.64 (95% CI, 0.47-0.88) and 0.53 (95% CI, 0.41-0.69), respectively, at month 42. Treatment effects for NT-proBNP and 6-minute walk distance also favored continuous acoramidis. On initiation of open-label acoramidis in the placebo-to-acoramidis arm, there was a prompt increase in serum transthyretin. Quality of life assessed by Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire Overall Summary score was well preserved in continuous-acoramidis participants compared with the placebo-to-acoramidis participants. No new clinically important safety issues were identified in this long-term evaluation. CONCLUSIONS: Early initiation and continuous use of acoramidis in the ATTRibute-CM study through month 42 of the ongoing OLE study were associated with sustained clinical benefits in a contemporary transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy cohort, with no clinically important safety issues newly identified.

%X BACKGROUND: Transthyretin (TTR) amyloidosis is an underdiagnosed disease caused by destabilization of TTR due to pathogenic mutations or aging. Both pathogenic and protective mutations illuminate mechanisms of disease and potential interventions. AG10 is a selective, oral TTR stabilizer under development for transthyretin amyloidosis cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM) that mimics a protective TTR mutation. OBJECTIVES: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluated safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of AG10 in ATTR-CM patients with symptomatic, chronic heart failure. METHODS: ATTR-CM, New York Heart Association functional class II to III subjects (n = 49, mutant or wild-type) were randomized 1:1:1 to AG10 400 mg, AG10 800 mg, or placebo twice daily for 28 days. Safety and tolerability were assessed by clinical and laboratory criteria. AG10 plasma levels were measured. TTR stability was assessed by changes in serum TTR, and 2 established ex vivo assays (fluorescent probe exclusion and Western blot). RESULTS: AG10 treatment was well-tolerated, achieved target plasma concentrations and demonstrated near-complete stabilization of TTR. TTR stabilization was more complete and less variable at the higher dose with stabilization by fluorescent probe exclusion of 92 ± 10% (mean ± SD) at trough and 96 ± 9% at peak (both p < 10(-12) vs. placebo). Average serum TTR increased by 36 ± 21% and 51 ± 38% at 400 and 800 mg, respectively (both p < 0.0001 vs. placebo). Baseline serum TTR in treated subjects was below normal in 80% of mutant and 33% of wild-type subjects. AG10 treatment restored serum TTR to the normal range in all subjects. CONCLUSIONS: AG10 has the potential to be a safe and effective treatment for patients with ATTR-CM. A phase 3 trial is ongoing. (Study of AG10 in Amyloid Cardiomyopathy; NCT03458130).

%X PURPOSE: The Phase 3 ENDEAVOUR study evaluated revusiran, an investigational RNA interference therapeutic targeting hepatic transthyretin (TTR) production, for treating cardiomyopathy caused by hereditary transthyretin-mediated (hATTR) amyloidosis. METHODS: Patients with hATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy were randomized 2:1 to receive subcutaneous daily revusiran 500 mg (n = 140) or placebo (n = 66) for 5 days over a week followed by weekly doses. Co-primary endpoints were 6-min walk test distance and serum TTR reduction. RESULTS: Revusiran treatment was stopped after a median of 6.71 months; the study Sponsor prematurely discontinued dosing due to an observed mortality imbalance between treatment arms. Eighteen (12.9%) patients on revusiran and 2 (3.0%) on placebo died during the on-treatment period. Most deaths in both treatment arms were adjudicated as cardiovascular due to heart failure (HF), consistent with the natural history of the disease. A post hoc safety investigation of patients treated with revusiran found that, at baseline, a greater proportion of those who died were ≥ 75 years and showed clinical evidence of more advanced HF compared with those who were alive throughout treatment. Revusiran pharmacokinetic exposures and TTR lowering did not show meaningful differences between patients who died and who were alive. Revusiran did not deleteriously affect echocardiographic parameters, cardiac biomarkers, or frequency of cardiovascular and HF hospitalization events. CONCLUSIONS: Causes for the observed mortality imbalance associated with revusiran were thoroughly investigated and no clear causative mechanism could be identified. Although the results suggest similar progression of cardiac parameters in both treatment arms, a role for revusiran cannot be excluded. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT02319005.

%X AIMS: The transthyretin (TTR) stabilizer, tafamidis, has demonstrated efficacy and safety in the treatment of TTR familial amyloid polyneuropathy (20 mg day(-1) ). Tafamidis use in TTR cardiomyopathy led to the study of the potential effect of tafamidis on the QTc interval in healthy subjects. METHODS: This randomized, three treatment, three period, six sequence crossover study with placebo, a positive control (moxifloxacin 400 mg) and tafamidis (400 mg, to achieve a supra-therapeutic Cmax of ~20 µg ml(-1) ) was conducted in healthy volunteers at three clinical research units. Oral dosing in each of the three treatment periods was separated by a washout period of  ≥ 14 days. Serial triplicate 12-lead electrocardiograms were performed. QTc intervals were derived using the Fridericia correction method. Safety and tolerability were assessed by physical examination, vital signs measurement, laboratory analyses and monitoring of adverse events (AEs). RESULTS: A total of 42 subjects completed the study. The upper limit of the two-sided 90% confidence intervals (CIs) for the difference in baseline-adjusted QTc F between tafamidis 400 mg and placebo was <10 ms (non-inferiority criterion) for all time points. The lower limit of the two-sided 90% CI between moxifloxacin 400 mg and placebo exceeded 5 ms at the pre-specified moxifloxacin tmax of 3 h post-dose, confirming assay sensitivity. Cmax and AUC(0,24 h) for tafamidis were 20.36 µg ml(-1) and 305.4 µg ml(-1) h, respectively. There were no serious/severe AEs or treatment discontinuations due to AEs. CONCLUSIONS: This thorough QTc study suggests that a supra-therapeutic single 400 mg oral dose of tafamidis does not prolong the QTc interval and is well-tolerated in healthy volunteers.

%X Tafamidis, a non-nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory benzoxazole derivative, acts as a transthyretin (TTR) stabilizer to slow progression of TTR amyloidosis (ATTR). Tafamidis meglumine, available as 20-mg capsules, is approved in more than 40 countries worldwide for the treatment of adults with early-stage symptomatic ATTR polyneuropathy. This agent, administered as an 80-mg, once-daily dose (4 × 20-mg capsules), is approved in the United States, Japan, Canada, and Brazil for the treatment of hereditary and wild-type ATTR cardiomyopathy in adults. An alternative single solid oral dosage formulation (tafamidis 61-mg free acid capsules) was developed and introduced for patient convenience (approved in the United States, United Arab Emirates, and European Union). In this single-center, open-label, randomized, 2-period, 2-sequence, crossover, multiple-dose phase 1 study, the rate and extent of absorption were compared between tafamidis 61-mg free acid capsules (test) and tafamidis meglumine 80-mg (4 × 20-mg) capsules (reference) after 7 days of repeated oral dosing under fasted conditions in 30 healthy volunteers. Ratios of adjusted geometric means (90%CI) for the test/reference formulations were 102.3 (98.0-106.8) for area under the concentration-time profile over the dosing interval and 94.1 (89.1-99.4) for the maximum observed concentration, satisfying prespecified bioequivalence acceptance criteria (90%CI, 80-125). Both tafamidis regimens had an acceptable safety/tolerability profile in this population.

%X Notwithstanding the dramatic improvement associated with Tafamidis in Heart Failure due to wild-type transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis (ATTRwt-CA), the effect of exercise training on ATTRwt-CA remains unexplored. We hereby present rationale and design of the Exercise training and Rehabilitation in Cardiac Amyloidosis study. This interventional, controlled study will randomize ATTRwt-CA patients into a control group and a training group. Primary endpoint will be the distance obtained at the 6-min walk test. Quality-of-life, peak oxygen consumption, left and right heart architecture and function, and natriuretic peptides will be secondary endpoints.

%X BACKGROUND: Hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTRv) is associated with polyneuropathy, cardiomyopathy, or both. The effects of eplontersen on cardiac structure and function were assessed. METHODS AND RESULTS: NEURO-TTRansform was an open-label trial involving 144 adults with ATTRv polyneuropathy (49 patients [34%] with cardiomyopathy) receiving eplontersen throughout and compared with a historical placebo group (n = 60; 30 patients [50%] with cardiomyopathy) from the NEURO-TTR trial at week 65. Treatment effect (eplontersen vs placebo), presented as mean difference (95% confidence interval) was analyzed after adjusting for age, sex, region, baseline value, ATTRv disease stage, previous ATTRv treatment, and V30M transthyretin variant. There were notable differences at baseline between the eplontersen group and historical placebo. In the cardiomyopathy subgroup, 65 weeks of eplontersen treatment was associated with improvement from baseline relative to placebo in left ventricular ejection fraction of 4.3% (95% confidence interval 1.40-21.01; P = .049) and stroke volume 10.64 mL (95% confidence interval 3.99-17.29; P = .002) while the remainder of echocardiographic parameters remained stable. CONCLUSIONS: Eplontersen was associated with stable or improved measures of cardiac structure and function vs historical placebo in patients with ATTRv polyneuropathy and cardiomyopathy. Further investigation into eplontersen's effect on transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy is being conducted in the CARDIO-TTRansform trial.

%X BACKGROUND: Transthyretin amyloidosis, also called ATTR amyloidosis, is associated with accumulation of ATTR amyloid deposits in the heart and commonly manifests as progressive cardiomyopathy. Patisiran, an RNA interference therapeutic agent, inhibits the production of hepatic transthyretin. METHODS: In this phase 3, double-blind, randomized trial, we assigned patients with hereditary, also known as variant, or wild-type ATTR cardiac amyloidosis, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive patisiran (0.3 mg per kilogram of body weight) or placebo once every 3 weeks for 12 months. A hierarchical procedure was used to test the primary and three secondary end points. The primary end point was the change from baseline in the distance covered on the 6-minute walk test at 12 months. The first secondary end point was the change from baseline to month 12 in the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire-Overall Summary (KCCQ-OS) score (with higher scores indicating better health status). The second secondary end point was a composite of death from any cause, cardiovascular events, and change from baseline in the 6-minute walk test distance over 12 months. The third secondary end point was a composite of death from any cause, hospitalizations for any cause, and urgent heart failure visits over 12 months. RESULTS: A total of 360 patients were randomly assigned to receive patisiran (181 patients) or placebo (179 patients). At month 12, the decline in the 6-minute walk distance was lower in the patisiran group than in the placebo group (Hodges-Lehmann estimate of median difference, 14.69 m; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.69 to 28.69; P = 0.02); the KCCQ-OS score increased in the patisiran group and declined in the placebo group (least-squares mean difference, 3.7 points; 95% CI, 0.2 to 7.2; P = 0.04). Significant benefits were not observed for the second secondary end point. Infusion-related reactions, arthralgia, and muscle spasms occurred more often among patients in the patisiran group than among those in the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: In this trial, administration of patisiran over a period of 12 months resulted in preserved functional capacity in patients with ATTR cardiac amyloidosis.

%X BACKGROUND: Transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy is caused by the deposition of transthyretin amyloid fibrils in the myocardium. The deposition occurs when wild-type or variant transthyretin becomes unstable and misfolds. Tafamidis binds to transthyretin, preventing tetramer dissociation and amyloidogenesis. METHODS: In a multicenter, international, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned 441 patients with transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy in a 2:1:2 ratio to receive 80 mg of tafamidis, 20 mg of tafamidis, or placebo for 30 months. In the primary analysis, we hierarchically assessed all-cause mortality, followed by frequency of cardiovascular-related hospitalizations according to the Finkelstein-Schoenfeld method. Key secondary end points were the change from baseline to month 30 for the 6-minute walk test and the score on the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire-Overall Summary (KCCQ-OS), in which higher scores indicate better health status. RESULTS: In the primary analysis, all-cause mortality and rates of cardiovascular-related hospitalizations were lower among the 264 patients who received tafamidis than among the 177 patients who received placebo (P<0.001). Tafamidis was associated with lower all-cause mortality than placebo (78 of 264 [29.5%] vs. 76 of 177 [42.9%]; hazard ratio, 0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.51 to 0.96) and a lower rate of cardiovascular-related hospitalizations, with a relative risk ratio of 0.68 (0.48 per year vs. 0.70 per year; 95% CI, 0.56 to 0.81). At month 30, tafamidis was also associated with a lower rate of decline in distance for the 6-minute walk test (P<0.001) and a lower rate of decline in KCCQ-OS score (P<0.001). The incidence and types of adverse events were similar in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy, tafamidis was associated with reductions in all-cause mortality and cardiovascular-related hospitalizations and reduced the decline in functional capacity and quality of life as compared with placebo.

%X BACKGROUND: Patisiran rapidly knocked down transthyretin and preserved functional capacity in patients with transthyretin amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM) in the global Phase 3 APOLLO-B study (NCT03997383). OBJECTIVES: To evaluate patisiran efficacy and safety in post hoc analysis of the Brazilian subpopulation of APOLLO-B. METHODS: Patients were randomized 1:1 to patisiran 0.3 mg/kg or placebo every 3 weeks for 12 months. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline (CFB) in functional capacity (6-minute walk test [6MWT]) at Month 12. Secondary endpoints included CFB to Month 12 in the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire-Overall Summary (KCCQ-OS) score. Exploratory endpoints included CFB in cardiac biomarkers and Perugini grade of cardiac uptake during technetium-99m scintigraphy. RESULTS: Forty-two patients enrolled in Brazil (patisiran, n=20; placebo, n=22). Patisiran showed benefit in 6MWT and KCCQ-OS scores vs. placebo; CFB (95% confidence interval [CI]) in 6MWT (median) and KCCQ-OS scores (least squares mean) was -2.0 m (-58.5, 42.9) and 9.37 (1.93, 16.81) points with patisiran vs. -30.1 m (-72.2, 3.5) and 2.62 (-4.68, 9.92) points for placebo. For cardiac biomarkers, the mean fold-change from baseline (95% CI) for N-terminal prohormone B-type natriuretic peptide and troponin I was 1.31 (1.06, 1.61) and 1.12 (0.94, 1.34) for patisiran, and 1.71 (1.39, 2.10) and 1.28 (1.08, 1.53) for placebo, respectively. Perugini grade improved in 11/18 (61.1%) and 0/10 evaluable patients with patisiran and placebo, respectively. There were no deaths in the patisiran group vs. 3 in the placebo group.

%X NI006 (aka ALXN2220) is a therapeutic antibody candidate in phase III clinical development for the depletion of amyloid transthyretin (ATTR) in patients with ATTR cardiomyopathy, an infiltrative cardiomyopathy leading to increased left ventricular wall thickness (LVWT). The mode-of-action consists in removal of disease-causing amyloid accumulations by activating phagocytic immune cells, a mechanism without precedent in cardiology. To select a safe and potentially efficacious dose range and treatment duration for a combined first-in-human and proof-of-concept clinical phase Ib study, we developed a mechanistic pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) model that can predict NI006 exposure, its effects on cardiac amyloid load and on LWVT, which is a predictor of heart failure in this disease. The PK/PD model predictions supported 0.3 mg/kg monthly dosing as a safe starting dose and identified 10-60 mg/kg monthly as the potentially efficacious dose range with substantial and dose dependent cardiac amyloid burden reduction within 4 months for 60 mg/kg and 10 months for 10 mg/kg. These predictions were in good agreement with the observed primary results of the clinical phase Ib study where amyloid burden was measured by imaging. This novel translational PK/PD model provided important predictions to guide the design of the phase Ib study of NI006, indicating the value of this approach to integrate preclinical results into clinical trial design and increase translational success.

%X In the Tafamidis in Transthyretin Cardiomyopathy Clinical Trial (ATTR-ACT), tafamidis significantly reduced mortality and cardiovascular (CV)-related hospitalizations compared with placebo in patients with transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM). This analysis aimed to assess the causes of CV-related death and hospitalization in ATTR-ACT to provide further insight into the progression of ATTR-CM and efficacy of tafamidis. ATTR-ACT was an international, double-blind, placebo-controlled, and randomized study. Patients with hereditary or wild-type ATTR-CM were randomized to tafamidis (n = 264) or placebo (n = 177) for 30 months. The independent Endpoint Adjudication Committee determined whether certain investigator-reported events met the definition of disease-related efficacy endpoints using predefined criteria. Cause-specific reasons for CV-related deaths (heart failure [HF], arrhythmia, myocardial infarction, sudden death, stroke, and other CV causes) and hospitalizations (HF, arrhythmia, myocardial infarction, transient ischemic attack/stroke, and other CV causes) were assessed. Total CV-related deaths was 53 (20.1%) with tafamidis and 50 (28.2%) with placebo, with HF (15.5% tafamidis, 22.6% placebo), followed by sudden death (2.7% tafamidis, 5.1% placebo), the most common causes. The number of patients with a CV-related hospitalization was 138 (52.3%) with tafamidis and 107 (60.5%) with placebo; with HF the most common cause (43.2% tafamidis, 50.3% placebo). All predefined causes of CV-related death or hospitalization were less frequent with tafamidis than placebo. In conclusion, these data provide further insight into CV disease progression in patients with ATTR-CM, with HF the most common adjudicated cause of CV-related hospitalization or death in ATTR-ACT.

%X BACKGROUND: Hereditary transthyretin-mediated (hATTR) amyloidosis is a rapidly progressive, multisystem disease that presents with cardiomyopathy or polyneuropathy. The APOLLO study assessed the efficacy and tolerability of patisiran in patients with hATTR amyloidosis. The effects of patisiran on cardiac structure and function in a prespecified subpopulation of patients with evidence of cardiac amyloid involvement at baseline were assessed. METHODS: APOLLO was an international, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial in patients with hATTR amyloidosis. Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive 0.3 mg/kg patisiran or placebo via intravenous infusion once every 3 weeks for 18 months. The prespecified cardiac subpopulation comprised patients with a baseline left ventricular wall thickness ≥13 mm and no history of hypertension or aortic valve disease. Prespecified exploratory cardiac end points included mean left ventricular wall thickness, global longitudinal strain, and N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide. Cardiac parameters in the overall APOLLO patient population were also evaluated. A composite end point of cardiac hospitalizations and all-cause mortality was assessed in a post hoc analysis. RESULTS: In the cardiac subpopulation (n=126; 56% of total population), patisiran reduced mean left ventricular wall thickness (least-squares mean difference ± SEM: -0.9±0.4 mm, P=0.017), interventricular septal wall thickness, posterior wall thickness, and relative wall thickness at month 18 compared with placebo. Patisiran also led to increased end-diastolic volume (8.3±3.9 mL, P=0.036), decreased global longitudinal strain (-1.4±0.6%, P=0.015), and increased cardiac output (0.38±0.19 L/min, P=0.044) compared with placebo at month 18. Patisiran lowered N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide at 9 and 18 months (at 18 months, ratio of fold-change patisiran/placebo 0.45, P<0.001). A consistent effect on N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide at 18 months was observed in the overall APOLLO patient population (n=225). Median follow-up duration was 18.7 months. The exposure-adjusted rates of cardiac hospitalizations and all-cause death were 18.7 and 10.1 per 100 patient-years in the placebo and patisiran groups, respectively (Andersen-Gill hazard ratio, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.28-1.01). CONCLUSIONS: Patisiran decreased mean left ventricular wall thickness, global longitudinal strain, N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide, and adverse cardiac outcomes compared with placebo at month 18, suggesting that patisiran may halt or reverse the progression of the cardiac manifestations of hATTR amyloidosis.

%X AIMS: Amyloidogenic transthyretin (ATTR) amyloidosis is a fatal disease characterized by progressive cardiomyopathy and/or polyneuropathy. AKCEA-TTR-L(Rx) (ION-682884) is a ligand-conjugated antisense drug designed for receptor-mediated uptake by hepatocytes, the primary source of circulating transthyretin (TTR). Enhanced delivery of the antisense pharmacophore is expected to increase drug potency and support lower, less frequent dosing in treatment. METHODS AND RESULTS: AKCEA-TTR-L(Rx) demonstrated an approximate 50-fold and 30-fold increase in potency compared with the unconjugated antisense drug, inotersen, in human hepatocyte cell culture and mice expressing a mutated human genomic TTR sequence, respectively. This increase in potency was supported by a preferential distribution of AKCEA-TTR-L(Rx) to liver hepatocytes in the transgenic hTTR mouse model. A randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 1 study was conducted to evaluate AKCEA-TTR-L(Rx) in healthy volunteers (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03728634). Eligible participants were assigned to one of three multiple-dose cohorts (45, 60, and 90 mg) or a single-dose cohort (120 mg), and then randomized 10:2 (active : placebo) to receive a total of 4 SC doses (Day 1, 29, 57, and 85) in the multiple-dose cohorts or 1 SC dose in the single-dose cohort. The primary endpoint was safety and tolerability; pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics were secondary endpoints. All randomized participants completed treatment. No serious adverse events were reported. In the multiple-dose cohorts, AKCEA-TTR-L(Rx) reduced TTR levels from baseline to 2 weeks after the last dose of 45, 60, or 90 mg by a mean (SD) of -85.7% (8.0), -90.5% (7.4), and -93.8% (3.4), compared with -5.9% (14.0) for pooled placebo (P < 0.001). A maximum mean (SD) reduction in TTR levels of -86.3% (6.5) from baseline was achieved after a single dose of 120 mg AKCEA-TTR-L(Rx) . CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest an improved safety and tolerability profile with the increase in potency achieved by productive receptor-mediated uptake of AKCEA-TTR-L(Rx) by hepatocytes and supports further development of AKCEA-TTR-L(Rx) for the treatment of ATTR polyneuropathy and cardiomyopathy.

%X BACKGROUND: Hereditary transthyretin (ATTRm) amyloidosis is a rare, progressive and fatal disease with a range of clinical manifestations. OBJECTIVE: This study comprehensively evaluates disease characteristics in a large, diverse cohort of patients with ATTRm amyloidosis. METHODS: Adult patients (N = 172) with Stage 1 or Stage 2 ATTRm amyloidosis who had polyneuropathy were screened and enrolled across 24 investigative sites and 10 countries in the NEURO-TTR trial ( www.clinicaltrials.gov , NCT01737398). Medical and disease history, quality of life, laboratory data, and clinical assessments were analyzed. RESULTS: The NEURO-TTR patient population was diverse in age, disease severity, TTR mutation, and organ involvement. Twenty-seven different TTR mutations were present, with Val30Met being the most common (52%). One third of patients reported early onset disease (before age 50) and the average duration of neuropathy symptoms was 5.3 years. Symptoms affected multiple organs and systems, with nearly 70% of patients exhibiting broad involvement of weakness, sensory loss, and autonomic disturbance. Over 60% of patients had cardiomyopathy, with highest prevalence in the United States (72%) and lowest in South America/Australasia (33%). Cardiac biomarker NT-proBNP correlated with left ventricular wall thickness (p<.001). Quality of life, measured by Norfolk QoL-DN and SF-36 patient-reported questionnaires, was significantly impaired and correlated with disease severity. CONCLUSIONS: Baseline data from the NEURO-TTR trial demonstrates ATTRm amyloidosis as a systemic disease with deficits in multiple organs and body systems, leading to decreased quality of life. We report concomitant presentation of polyneuropathy and cardiomyopathy in most patients, and early involvement of multiple body systems.
